# An Autonomous Mobile Robot Applied to Solar Panel Cleaning

Work developed to obtain the Diploma of Electrical Engineer (B. Eng. Degree) at the Universidade Federal do Semi-√Årido (UFERSA).
The work was used to attempt and [init a Startup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8fqeE2K3xI), being approved in the initial processes of some accelerators (Baita, Tech Stars, ENEL Open Innovability).
The video of the robot working on a solar panel can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/CHU0mq67Dy4).
